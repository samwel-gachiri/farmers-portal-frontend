      <h1 class="tw-text-4xl tw-font-bold tw-text-gray-900 tw-mb-2">AgriBackup Terms of Service</h1>
      <div class="tw-text-gray-500 tw-mb-8 tw-flex tw-flex-col sm:tw-flex-row sm:tw-gap-6">
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 13, 2026</p>
        <p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1 (Global Compliance Standard)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tw-prose tw-prose-lg tw-text-gray-700">

        <h2 class="tw-text-2xl tw-font-bold tw-mt-8 tw-mb-4">1. Acceptance & Professional Capacity</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using the AgriBackup platform ("Platform"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you are using the Platform on behalf of a business entity (e.g., a Coffee Cooperative or Avocado Exporter), you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these terms. Use of the Platform for fraudulent or non-commercial purposes is strictly prohibited.</p>

        <h2 class="tw-text-2xl tw-font-bold tw-mt-8 tw-mb-4">2. Scope of Service: "Compliance-as-a-Service"</h2>
        <p>AgriBackup provides a cloud-based Compliance-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform designed to facilitate due diligence for the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and other global traceability standards.</p>
        <ul class="tw-list-none tw-pl-0 tw-space-y-4 tw-mt-4">
          <li class="tw-pl-4 tw-border-l-4 tw-border-green-500">
            <strong>The Tools:</strong> Our Platform provides GPS mapping, satellite-based deforestation analysis, and "Audit-Ready" reporting modules.
          </li>
          <li class="tw-pl-4 tw-border-l-4 tw-border-red-500">
            <strong>The Limitation:</strong> AgriBackup is a decision-support tool. We provide high-probability indicators of compliance; however, the final legal responsibility for meeting EUDR or other regulatory requirements rests solely with the Operator or Trader as defined by law.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="tw-text-2xl tw-font-bold tw-mt-8 tw-mb-4">3. Data Integrity & "Proof of Truth"</h2>
        <p>The value of our network depends on the accuracy of its data.</p>
        <ul class="tw-list-disc tw-pl-6 tw-space-y-2 tw-mt-2">
          <li><strong>User Warranty:</strong> You warrant that all information you upload—including GPS polygons, farm boundaries, and production volumes—is accurate and truthful.</li>
          <li><strong>Anti-Spoofing:</strong> Any attempt to provide fraudulent geolocation data or "spoof" farm boundaries is a material breach of this agreement. Such actions will result in immediate account termination and a permanent record of the attempt on our system logs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="tw-text-2xl tw-font-bold tw-mt-8 tw-mb-4">4. Intellectual Property & Data Ownership</h2>
        <p>We follow a "First Principles" approach to data: You own the raw material; we own the machine.</p>
        <ul class="tw-list-disc tw-pl-6 tw-space-y-2 tw-mt-2">
          <li><strong>Your Data:</strong> You retain all right, title, and interest in and to the data you upload ("User Data").</li>
          <li><strong>Our License:</strong> To provide the service, you grant AgriBackup a non-exclusive, global, royalty-free license to host, process, and analyze your data. This includes the right to run satellite analysis algorithms against your farm polygons to generate compliance reports.</li>
          <li><strong>System IP:</strong> AgriBackup owns all rights to the Platform architecture, code, UI/UX design, and any "Aggregated Insights" derived from anonymized data trends.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="tw-text-2xl tw-font-bold tw-mt-8 tw-mb-4">5. Limitation of Liability & Risk Transfer</h2>
        <p>As a technology provider, AgriBackup’s liability is capped to ensure the sustainability of our global infrastructure:</p>
        <ul class="tw-list-disc tw-pl-6 tw-space-y-2 tw-mt-2">
          <li><strong>"As-Is" Provision:</strong> The Platform is provided on an "As-Is" and "As-Available" basis. While we strive for 99.9% uptime, we are not liable for losses caused by temporary server downtime.</li>
          <li><strong>Cap on Damages:</strong> In no event shall AgriBackup’s total liability for any claim exceed the total fees paid by you to AgriBackup in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.</li>
          <li><strong>No Consequential Loss:</strong> We are not liable for lost profits, trade bans, or regulatory fines incurred by you, even if the system provided a "Compliant" indicator. Verification with on-the-ground reality remains your duty.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="tw-text-2xl tw-font-bold tw-mt-8 tw-mb-4">6. Subscriptions, Payments, & Access</h2>
        <ul class="tw-list-disc tw-pl-6 tw-space-y-2 tw-mt-2">
          <li><strong>Access Tokens:</strong> To ensure a "luxurious" user experience, session tokens are set to a 30-day expiry. However, we reserve the right to revoke access immediately if a security threat is detected.</li>
          <li><strong>Billing:</strong> Access to advanced exporter dashboards and "Audit-Ready" PDF generation requires a paid subscription. Failure to pay within thirty (30) days of an invoice will result in the suspension of automated compliance features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="tw-text-2xl tw-font-bold tw-mt-8 tw-mb-4">7. Termination & Data Exit</h2>
        <ul class="tw-list-disc tw-pl-6 tw-space-y-2 tw-mt-2">
          <li><strong>Termination for Convenience:</strong> You may stop using the Platform at any time.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Retrieval:</strong> Upon termination, you have the right to export your farm polygons and compliance history in a standard format (GeoJSON/CSV) for up to thirty (30) days. After this period, we may delete non-essential data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="tw-text-2xl tw-font-bold tw-mt-8 tw-mb-4">8. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>This agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Kenya, with an eye toward international arbitration for global trade disputes. Any disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration in Nairobi, under the rules of the Nairobi Centre for International Arbitration.</p>
